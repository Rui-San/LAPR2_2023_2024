## Introduction

This user manual was designed as a guide to help users navigate and comprehend the functionalities of our application
effectively. Its purpose is to provide step-by-step instructions for users to operate the application in the easiest way and efficiently.


## System Overview

The main objective of this Java-built application is to provide a solution that supports the activities of an
organization responsible for managing green spaces, predominantly in urban contexts.

Through the use of this application, users have at their disposal a set of functionalities that streamline the company's
activities, making management more efficient, facilitating planning and coordination of its activities.

Through a user-friendly interface, the system enables managers to register collaborators, jobs, and skills, which allows
the manager to automatically create a team that will execute tasks of an agenda, ensuring greater efficiency and
coordination in the work.

Furthermore, the application facilitates the fleet management, including vehicles, machinery, and equipment through
functionalities that allow the registration of the organization's vehicles, as well as the management of vehicle
check-ups.

The application will also provide a portal where green space users can access information about green spaces, report
problems and malfunctions or suggest improvements.

To demonstrate more easily how the application works, we have developed a diagram that shows the system's
functionalities and the dependencies that exist between them.
