As a Green Space Manager (GSM), I want to register a green
space (garden, medium-sized park or large-sized park) and its respective
area.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> Green spaces for collective use can vary significantly in dimensions and
available amenities. They may range from small landscaped areas, parks
with trees and some amenities like benches or playgrounds, to parks with
multiple hectares (e.g., in Porto, there are the Parque da Cidade - City 
 Park the Parque Oriental - the Oriental Park), wooded areas, lakes, and various
 facilities and installations.

>MusgoSublime (MS) is an organization dedicated to the planning, construction and maintenance of green spaces for collective use in their multiple
  dimensions, namely: plant material (e.g. flowers, shrubs, trees); urban furniture (e.g. benches, tables, gymnastics equipment); irrigation systems and
  drinking fountains; lighting systems and the respective power supply; rainwater conduction and drainage systems.

size and installed equipment: <br>

(may have a basic irrigation system or/and benches);<br>

square meters with a wooded garden area, it includes some infrastructures such as toilets, drinking fountains, irrigation system, lighting,
children’s playground (for example, Quinta do Covelo, Jardim d’Arca
de Agua ´ );<br>
