# US022 - Add new entry in the Agenda


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a GSM, I want to add a new entry in the Agenda.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	In the daily management, the GSM uses two essential tools: the Agenda and the Task
List (aka To-Do List). 

>	The Agenda is a crucial mechanism for planning the weekâ€™s work. Each entry
in the Agenda defines a task (that was previously included in the to-do list).
> 
**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When the GSM plans a task (that was previously in To-Do) into the Agenda, what aditional data/information does he need to input when planning?
>
> **Answer:** The starting date for the task. Later the GSM will be able to add the Team and vehicles (if required)

> **Question:** When a new entry is added to the ToDo list, the default status of that task will be "pending" or no status at all is considered on ToDo list?
Similarly, when a new entry is added to the Agenda, the status of that task will be, by default, set to "planned", right?
>
> **Answer:** "Pending" as default for to-do list entries and "Planned" as default for Agenda entries, sounds good;

> **Question:** Can I add an entry that has a time period that already have an existing entry in the Agenda?
>
> **Answer:** Yes, because:
a) there are many parks to manage
b) different tasks can be executed at same time in the same park. 


> **Question:** When registering an entry to the agenda, are the three inputs (selecting an existing task from the to-do list, starting date, and finishing date) sufficient?
>
> **Answer:** The starting date will be enough because the task already has the predicted duration.
