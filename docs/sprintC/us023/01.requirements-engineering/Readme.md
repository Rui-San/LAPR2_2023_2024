### 1.1. User Story Description

As a GSM, I want to assign a Team to an entry in the Agenda.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>  The Agenda is made up of entries that relate to a task (which was previously in the To-Do List),
the team that will carry out the task, the vehicles/equipment assigned to
the task, expected duration, and the status (Planned, Postponed, Canceled,
Done).

**From the client clarifications:**

>
> **Answer:** Yes.
