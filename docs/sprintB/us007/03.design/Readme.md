| Step 1: Asks to register a new vehicle's check-up         | ... instantiating the class that handles the UI?                      | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
|                                                           | ... obtaining the vehicle checkup list?                               | VehicleRepository        | Information Expert, Pure Fabrication |  
| Step 2: Shows the list of vehicles and asks to select one | ... displaying the Vehicle list?                                      | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
| Step 3: Selects a vehicle                                 | ... validating selected data?                                         | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
|                                                           | ... temporarily keeping the Vehicle?                                  | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
| Step 4: Requests check-up data                            | ... displaying the form for the actor to input data?                  | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
| Step 5: Types requested data                              | ... validating input data?                                            | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
|                                                           | ... temporarily keeping input data?                                   | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
| Step 6: Shows all data and requests confirmation          | ... displaying all the information before submitting?                 | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |
| Step 7: Confirms data                                     | ... creating the Vehicle Checkup object?                              | VehicleCheckupRepository | Creator                              |
|                                                           | ... validating the data locally (mandatory data)?                     | VehicleCheckup           | Information Expert                   |
|                                                           | ... adding to a collection and globally validating duplicate records? | VehicleCheckupRepository | Information Expert                   | 
| Setp 8: Displays operation success                        | ... informing operation success?                                      | RegisterCheckupUI        | Pure Fabrication                     |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* VehicleRepository
* VehicleCheckup
* VehicleCheckupRepository

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RegisterCheckupUI
